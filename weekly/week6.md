### Week 6

- Identified way to improve the project, and pitched the idea of refactoring Gomega assertions, and wrap them in
helper functions to enhance contributor experience. However, this introduces issues centered around maintainence of
the project.
- Incorporated feedback about the `tap` tests, and made the required changes.
- Started writing tests for `linkerd stat`
