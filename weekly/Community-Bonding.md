## Community Bonding Period

- Discussed the proposal to finalize the desirable objectives of the project and prioritized the tests that must be written.
- Discussed if Gomega and Ginkgo would be a good framework for writing the tests, and also discussed how Sonobuoy would fit into this project.
- Worked on the `emojivoto` repository to add the Redis and SQL components.
