### Week 5

- Implemented a Github Actions based CI for the repository that runs static checks like linting and formatting,
as well as runs the conformance tests on a KinD cluster. This ensures that the tests are in a working state
each time a PR is made.
- Opened issues for writing tests for various Linkerd CLI commands such as `tap`, `routes`, `stat` and `edges`.
- Started writing tests for `tap` feature
