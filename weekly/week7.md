### Week 7

- Finished working on `stat` tests and started extending ingress tests to test controllers like traefik, ambassador,
contour and gloo.
- Because the procedures for gloo and contour were very less, we decided to implement them in a separate PR.
- Finished writing tests for traefik, ambassador and nginx (refactor).
